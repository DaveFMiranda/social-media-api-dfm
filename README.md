# Social Media API

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)

## Description

This is a set of API routes and commands for the back end of a hypothetical social media site. Its database creates users and "thoughts," which are the equivalent of comments. It can also add a user to another user's friends list and add reactions to thoughts. Users can create, get all, update, delete, and retrieve single instances of specific users and thoughts. Users can also add and remove friends and add and remove reactions.

Here's a link to the deployed site: https://github.com/DaveFMiranda/social-media-api-dfm

Here's a walkthrough video demonstrating the program's functionality: https://watch.screencastify.com/v/D3k0RPfTlU15feJf6NN5

## Installation

## Usage

See thoughtRoutes.js and userRoutes.js in routes/api/ for API endpoints. The functions called at those endpoints by assorted CRUD commands are pretty self-explanatory. Use Insomnia or Thunder Client or some similar API testing program or plug-in to use the program.
